# Maze-Solver
## Descirption
This project uses depth first search to solve a maze. The DFS algorithm is applied to find a path from the entrance to the exit while managing the number of coins required to open doors along the way.

## How to Run
Class Solve.java shows how to use the iterator returned by the solve() method to draw the solution found by the algorithm on the screen. 
This class also contains the main method. To execute the program, in terminal you must type:
"java Solve Mazes/(inputfile)"
where inputFile is the name of the input file containing a description of the maze
Example: "java Solve Mazes/maze1.txt"
